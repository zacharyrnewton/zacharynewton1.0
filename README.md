# What’s up guys?
My name is Zachary Newton. I am a UI & UX Designer, a Developer, a YouTuber, and a Podcaster.

During the day, I work as a User Interface and User Experience Designer over at Augusta HiTech. After my day at work, I continue to pursue my passions of Design and Development by creating videos for the community that I am building on YouTube. I always create at least one tutorial video every Saturday, and I have challenged myself to start documenting everything I do by vlogging every weekday. I am very proud to say that I still have never missed a due date.

Aside from working on the things I mentioned above, I also run my own company, Zachary R Newton. This company is another means for me to continue educating myself while helping people and returning some value to the world around me.

Every other Saturday, I enjoy creating a podcast called “The Midnight Exchange” with my best friend. We talk about life and experiences that we have, in hopes to learn something valuable that we can apply to our lives.
